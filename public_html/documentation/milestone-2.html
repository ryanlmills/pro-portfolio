    <h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>My site will be a single page, consisting of the following sections:</p>
    <p><strong>Welcome:</strong> A brief welcome message stating an avatar, my name, and profession as a full-stack web dev. I will have to put together some background art that is reasonably techy and fits the color scheme.</p>
    <p><strong>About Me:</strong> An overview of my qualifications, skills, and interests. I'll list off languages and toolsets I've worked with and make a broadly appealing case for why I anyone reading the site should reach out to me--collaboration, employment, education.</p>
    <p><strong>Portfolio:</strong> A small gallery featuring a few examples of my best work in terms of the front and back ends. This will initially include things I produce during camp but will change over time, especially as I become more proficient with backend and produce some demonstration tutorials.</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Just a minimalist contact form for my professional email address and links to Twitter, Github, and Linkedin.</p>
    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>My site will a single-page layout optimized for small and large displays, and up to accessibility standards.</p>
