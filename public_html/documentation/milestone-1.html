        <h1>PWP Milestone 1</h1>
            <h2>Purpose, Audience, & Goal</h2>
                <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This project will be a professional portfolio website highlighting both
                    front-end and back-end web development.</p>
            <p><strong>Audience</strong>: This website has been designed primarily with web development and IT
                professionals in mind; however, it will also provide an example for non-professionals and students. The
                target audience is broadly made up of hiring managers, recruiters, recruiters, peers, and web
                development students/hobbyists.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal</strong>: The site's goals are to serve as a public-facing representation of my work and
                establish contact with users for the sake of employment, collaboration, and education through multiple
                avenues of communication provided.</p>
        <h2>Persona</h2>
            <img src="leanna.jpg" alt="Leanna Zamora professional photo" />
            <p><strong>Name</strong>: Leanna Zamora</p>
            <p><strong>Age</strong>: 37</p>

            <p><strong>Profession</strong>: Recruiter for Placeholder.io, a small startup seeking a full-time,
                entry-level front-end web developer. They specialize in enterprise, web, cloud, and
                mobile development projects.</p>
            <p><strong>Technology</strong>: Advanced Mac user. Recent MacBook Pro between home and office, iPhone
                11.</p>
            <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>: Her job is her life, frequently tasked with extra duties that
                don't quite fit her job description. As long as a resume passes basic muster for her, she'll dig into a
                portfolio extensively enough to try to get a feel for personality and work ethic in addition to
                skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong>: Leanna has gone through a series of candidates with decent
                enough resumes but lackluster portfolios. Her time frame is tight but she can't afford to make the wrong
                hire either. She is hoping that the option of remote work will balance out the moderate pay and
                benefits. Due to the remote nature of the position, the interview will be paramount in helping her
                find a self-starter.</p>
            <p><strong>Goals</strong>: Leanna needs to see a portfolio that displays the right personality in addition
                to technical skill.</p>
            <p><strong>User Story</strong>: As a user, I need to find work that displays both professionalism and a
                creative, meticulous standard of work.</p>
